      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>If you have been in the mood for a chicken dinner that is creamy and delicious that your whole family will love, this is perfect for you. Everything from the juicy chicken breast all the way to the healthy spinach gives this dish so much flavor.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>10 medium Granny Smith apples - peeled, cored, and sliced</li>
        <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li> ½ teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Make the pie crust: Whisk flour and salt together in a large bowl. Add butter and toss until pieces are completely separated and coated with flour mixture. Using your hands, work butter into the flour mixture until well combined and butter pieces are no larger than a pea.</li>
        <li>Gently stir in 1/4 cup cold water with a spatula until completely absorbed. Add remaining 1/4 cup water, 1 tablespoon at a time, gently stirring between each addition, until dough begins to form into a ball. Depending on how humid it is in your kitchen or how hydrated your flour is, you might not need to use all of the water.</li>
        <li>Transfer dough to a clean work surface and gently knead, being careful not to overwork it, until smooth and slightly tacky. Divide dough evenly into 2 pieces. Form each piece into a flat disk and wrap individually in plastic wrap. Chill dough in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour or up to 3 days. (If chilling for longer than 1 hour, let dough sit at room temperature for at least 15 minutes before rolling in Step 9.)</li>
        <li>While the dough is chilling, make the caramel sauce: Heat sugar in a small saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until completely melted and amber in color, 10 to 15 minutes. Add butter to melted sugar and cook, stirring constantly, until butter is melted and completely combined, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Carefully add heavy cream to sugar mixture, stirring constantly, until bubbly, 15 to 30 seconds. Remove saucepan from the heat and stir in sea salt. Set caramel sauce aside to cool slightly at room temperature until ready to use.</li>
        <li>Make the filling: Stir apples, sugar, flour, lemon juice, cornstarch, cinnamon, salt, cloves, and nutmeg together in a large bowl until well combined. Set apple mixture aside at room temperature, uncovered, for 30 minutes.</li>
      </ol>
